irBnB Clone Project

##  Overview

The **AirBnB Clone** is a full-stack web development project designed to mimic the core functionalities of the real AirBnB platform. It is part of the ALX Advanced Backend track and aims to help developers build a comprehensive understanding of web application architecture, API development, database modeling, and more.

This project will be developed incrementally, starting from a basic console application and evolving into a fully functioning web platform.

##  Project Goals

- Recreate the core features of the AirBnB website
- Build a custom backend system including data storage, RESTful APIs, and user management
- Learn best practices for backend architecture, security, and deployment
- Gain hands-on experience with Git, GitHub collaboration, and CI/CD workflows

##  Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3
- **Framework:** Flask (for web app/API)
- **Storage:** MySQL (database), File Storage (initially)
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
- **Web Server:** Gunicorn (for production deployment)
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS (basic templates)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Testing:** Unittest (Python's built-in test framework)

## Features to Implement

- Custom command-line interpreter
- Class models for users, places, states, cities, reviews, and amenities
- File and DB storage engines
- RESTful API endpoints
- Dynamic web pages with Flask
- Authentication and security measures
- Frontend integration
